# Peer to Peer Lending Credit Risk Analysis

## Using the fully library of machine learning models, we will run our lending dataset through each model to determine the model with the highest level of accuracy and sensitivity for predicting candidates who are at a high risk of defaulting on their loans. In our approach we will use undersampling, oversampling and SMOTEENN approach (a combination of both oversampling minority data and undersampling majority data) and compare the resulting confusion matrices and classification report statistics as metrics for the models success at predicting.


## Results:
### Naive Random Oversampling
- 
### SMOTE Oversampling
- 
### Undersampling
- 
### Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
- 
### Balanced Random Forest Classifier
- 
### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
- 

## Summary Analysis: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
